Optimization:
Bring MCM to one style (single event or States) - PRIO
Recode BodyTicker (mostly done (?) )
Add translation files(?)
SLA module

Features:
Wearing a gag makes you unable to ingest normal food
Arms and Hands training marginally decreases melee damage done
    but increases magic damage done (due to increased sensitivity)

Anal training makes you unable to orgasm without anal stimulation
    #^^^ would require some trickery with 'canorgasm' states

Reduce/increase carry weight depending on character weight/legs strength, etc
    #^^^ gotta workout logic/numbers first, shouldnt be too intrusive as to prevent player from playing the game
    #^^^ but should be relevant as not to be ignored by the player
    #^^^ most logical thing to do would be something interactive, but what :THONK: :question:

Add body specific options (BHUNP for example)
    #^^^ this is actual ez, check for morph plugin present, if it is -> use it

Settings for Devious Devices integration - PRIO

SexLab integration (change settings for example)

Optionally add SlaveTats effects
    #^^^ as im no artist, would require creative borrowing of assets KEKW
