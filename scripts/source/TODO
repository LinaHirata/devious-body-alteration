Redo Movement Speed effect - PRIO
Recode BodyTicker (mostly done (?) )
Add translation files(?)

Features:
Anal training makes you unable to orgasm without anal stimulation
    #^^^ would require some trickery with 'canorgasm' states
Vaginal training makes you 'wet' and 'horny' all the time (increases arousal, periodically or as a multiplier)
    #^^^ currently i dont see/know of a way to add global multiplier so it will probably be
    #^^^ periodical arousal increase equal to vagina training time over timespan of a day
Reduce/increase carry weight depending on character weight/legs strength, etc
    #^^^ gotta workout logic/numbers first, shouldnt be too intrusive as to prevent player from playing the game
    #^^^ but should be relevant as not to be ignored by the player
    #^^^ most logical thing to do would be something interactive, but what :THONK: :question:
Add processed food (?)/magic sustenance(?)/soul gems(?)
    #^^^ relevant only if survival mods are installed, needs integration to prevent normal food from working
Add body specific options (BHUNP for example)
    #^^^ this is actual ez, check for morph plugin present, if it is -> use it

Devious Devices and SexLab integration (change settings for example)
    #^^^ literally steal it from Devious Training
Optionally allow user to change HOW it is integrated with SexLab and Devious Devices

Optionally add SlaveTats effects
    #^^^ as im no artist, would require creative borrowing of assets KEKW
